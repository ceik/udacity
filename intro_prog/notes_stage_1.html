            The WWW is mainly made up out of <span class="keyword">HTML
            (Hypertext Markup Language) documents</span>, that are linked
            together via Hyperlinks. Browsers sends requests to servers via the
            internet and the HTTP protocol. Servers answer with documents,
            often in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="keyword">HTML Components</span> are mainly Text
            Content and Markup.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="keyword">Markup elements</span> usually have an opening
            and closing tag. The part between the tags is called
            <span class="keyword">content</span>. If and element consists of
            only one tag, e.g. the image tag, it is called a
            <span class="keyword">void element</span>. Markup elements can be
            either <span class="keyword">inline</span> (e.g.
            <span class="code">&lt;span></span>) or
            <span class="keyword">block</span> (e.g.
            <span class="code">&lt;div></span>). Block tags
            create a <span class="keyword">box</span> around the content.

            Elements that are not void are defined by an opening and closing tag.
            The content and can be empty, text, or another element. Tags can
            have <span class="keyword">attributes</span> with values. Examples
            of attributes are class or href, e.g.:
            <span class="code">&lt;a class="link"
                href="http://www.google.com"></span>
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML tags are being turned into elements by the browser. Elements
            can have other elements inside them, which leads to a
            <span class="keyword">tree-like structure of boxes</span>
            (because all elements are boxes). This structure is defined by the
            <span class="keyword">Document Object Model</span> or DOM. The DOM
            is the standard convention for representing and interacting with
            elements in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
            When thinking about the layout of a page it is essential to think
            in terms of boxes, because every element on the page will be a box.

    <h2 class="header">Lession 1.3 - Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            <span class="keyword">CSS</span> (Cascading Style Sheets) are an
            important addition to HTML. They provide an efficient way of
            changing the style of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to use CSS a few things should be kept in mind. The head
            of the html document needs to contain a link to the .css file in
            this format:
            <span class="code">&lt;link href="notes_stage_1.css" rel="stylesheet"></span>.
            Also it is very handy to give html elements a
            <span class="keyword">class</span> attribute and give the same class
            to similar elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            For an extensive <span class="keyword">CSS reference</span> see

            here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML does not have <span class="keyword">escape characters</span>.
            Instead ASCII code needs to be used for certain characters, e.g.
            &lt;, &amp;, and &quot;. ASCII codes have the following
            structure: &#38;#num; where num stands for a number or an
            alternative abbreviation. E.g. the num/abbreviation for the
            characters above are 60/lt, 38/amp, and 34/quot respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            A full <span class="keyword">ASCII reference table</span> in HTML
            can be found

        <p>
            There are two pages that can <span class="keyword">validate</span>
            and check HTML and CSS code:<br>
            <a class="link"
               href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">
               HTML Check</a><br>
            <a class="link"
               href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">

        <p>
            Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
Avoiding Errors: When programmers don't avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
Consistency: In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson div the same class and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.
