# Lesson 2.2: Variables

# Programmers use variables to represent values in their code.
# This makes code easier to read by telling others what values
# mean. It also makes code easier to write by cutting down on
# potentially complicated numbers that repeat in our code.

# We sometimes call numbers without a variable "magic numbers"
# It's best to reduce the amount of "magic numbers" in our code

speed_of_light = 299792458.0
billionth = 1.0 / 1000000000.0
nanostick = speed_of_light * billionth * 100
print nanostick

# Assignment Statement:
#     Name = Expression
# In python (and many other languages) the = means assignment (not equal)

# Quiz 1
speed_of_light = 299792458.0
cycles_per_second = 2700000000.0
print speed_of_light / cycles_per_second

# Quiz 4
age = 26
age_days = age * 365
print age_days



# Lesson 2.2: Strings

# Strings are sequences of characters that are enclosed in quotes.
# We can enclose them with single or double quotes and assign them
# to variables. We can even combine strings by adding them (we call
# this concatenation).

# https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-4192698630/m-48700403

print 'Hello'
print "Hello"

hello = "Howdy"
print hello

# String: Sequence of characters between quotes.

print 'hello' + ' sir'
print '!' * 23

# Charaters can be indexed: 'udacity'
#                            0123456
# The format is <string>[<expression>] or <string>[expression:expression] for a
# subsequence.
# The find method returns the first index of the string that is searched for. It
# returns a number, which is -1 if the string is not found. find can also take
# a second parameter that stands for the index where find is supposed to start
# searching.
# Another useful string method is replace:
# string.replace(old, new, max_replacements)
u = 'udacity'
print u[2]
print u[-2]
print u.find('u')
print (u+u).find('u', 3)




# Lesson 2.3: Procedures

# Functions (also known as procedures or methods) take input and return an output.
# Programmers use functions all the time! They may seem confusing at first but
# the more you use and make them, the better you'll get!

# https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-4141089439/m-48667860

def rest_of_string(s):
    return s[1:]

print rest_of_string('audacity')

# Add your own code and notes here

# Procedure: <procedure>(<input>, <input>, ...)
# Inputs are sometimes called operands or arguments.




# Lesson 2.4: Making Decisions - If Statements

# We'll often write programs that need to make comparisons between values.
# We can do comparisons just like we do in math with the < and > signs.
# We can also do equality comparisons with != (not equal) and ==.
# Comparisons always return a Boolean value (either True or False).

# https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-4196788670/e-48727556/m-48724313

print 2 < 3
print 21 < 3
print 7 * 3 < 21
print 7 * 3 != 21
print 7 * 3 == 21

# Lesson 2.4: While Loops

# Loops are an important concept in computer programming.
# Loops let us run blocks of code many times which can be
# really useful when we have to repeat tasks.

# https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-4196788670/e-48686708/m-48480488

def count():
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        print i
        i = i + 1

count()

# Lesson 2.6: Structured Data - Lists

# Similar to how strings are seuqences of characters, lists are
# sequences of anything! We can have lists of numbers, lists of
# characters, even lists of lists! And we can mix up the contents
# too so we can have lists containing many different things.

# https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-4180729266/m-48652460

p = ['y', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a', '!']
print p
print p[0]
print p[2:4]

# Add your own code and notes here

# Lists are mutable while strings are not.
# Because of this, whenever a list is mutated inside a function this will
# change the list in the global environment!


# Lesson 2.6: For Loops

# For loops, like while loops, are useful for running a block of code
# multiple times. For loops make iterating through elements in a list
# easier than using a while loop.

# https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-4152219158/m-48204891

def print_all_elements(p):
    for e in p:
        print e

myList = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
print_all_elements(myList)
